Read through the tour of rust and started learning how to apply Rust in exericses and problems I solved in languages I'm more proficient in.
However, I struggled a bit with smart pointers.
## 1 July 2025
Went through Lab 00 from MA to ensure I learned correctly.
Then, I began doing Rustlings, first exercises went smoothly.
## 2 July 2025
Continued Rustlings, till hashmaps, I didn't struggle as much, thats when exercises started increasing in difficulty.
## 3 July 2025
I managed to get to iterators, some of the exercises were a bit difficult but It was okay overall.
## 4 July 2025
Finished Rustlings
